Gonigsberg
==========

A Go pathfinding application 

###TODO:

1. Finish unit testing basic graph
2. Implement wayfinding algorithm (Dijkstra's?)
3. Figure out how to create a real TODO list in GitHub?

###Notes
Name is an uncreative amalgamation of *go* and KÃ¶nigsberg, the city whose seven bridges inspired Euler's Seven Bridge Problem, the origin of graph theory.

Created for a computer science independent study elective on graph theory at North Seattle College.
