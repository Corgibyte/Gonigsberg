A Go graph library

###TODO:

1. Undirected Graphs

  * Implement interface
3. Path Costs
  * Design: add to other interface? Wrap? New?
4. Algorithms
  * DFS

  * Priority Queue
  * Whatever I need to do the following
  * Dijkstra's Algorithm
5. Figure out how to create a real TODO list in GitHub?

###Notes
Name is an uncreative amalgamation of *go* and KÃ¶nigsberg, the city whose seven bridges inspired Euler's Seven Bridge Problem, the origin of graph theory.

Created for a computer science independent study elective on graph theory at North Seattle College.
